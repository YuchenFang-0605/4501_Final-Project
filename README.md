## Overview:

In this project, we aim to analyze diverse datasets related to New York City, focusing on zip code information, 311 complaints, trees, and historical average rents. The project is divided into four parts: data Preprocessing, data storing, data understanding, data visualizing.
#### Part 1: Data Preprocessing
In this section, we download data, clean and filter it, handle missing values, and generate relevant samples. This involves both manual and programmatic data retrieval, utilizing pandas and geopandas for cleaning, and ensuring data consistency.
#### Part 2: Storing Data
Part 2 involves creating a PostgreSQL database, turning on the PostGIS extension, and populating tables with cleaned datasets from Part 1. We use appropriate data types and indices for efficient data storage.
#### Part 3: Understanding Data
For Part 3, we craft SQL queries to gain insights into the datasets. Questions include identifying calm living areas, areas with the most greenery, rent affordability, and potential correlations between rent, trees, and 311 complaints.
#### Part 4: Visualizing Data
The final part focuses on creating visualizations using matplotlib and other libraries. We explore various aspects such as the most common complaints, correlations between rent, trees, and complaints, and geospatial plots of incidents and tree requests.
